# Job-Portal- Discover Your Path
In an era where job seekers are inundated with an overwhelming number of listings—many
of which do not align with their expertise—a groundbreaking hiring platform is introducing an
innovative mechanism that<b> restricts access to job opportunities</b> unless candidates can
substantiate their relevance. The philosophy behind this paradigm shift is that only
individuals who demonstrably possess the requisite skill set should be granted visibility into
potential career prospects.

<br>
Your objective is to architect a highly interactive job portal that strictly adheres to the
following principles:
<br>
●
<b>Complete Concealment:</b> Job listings must remain imperceptible by default, ensuring
that users are unable to browse any positions without demonstrating competency.
<br>
●
<b>Skill-Driven Discovery:</b> The portal should prompt users to manually input their
proficiencies. As the user enters skills, job postings that correlate with at least one of
the provided competencies should gradually materialize on the interface.
<br>
●
<b>Relevance-Based Prioritization:</b> Any position exhibiting an alignment of 80% or
greater with the user's skill set should be prominently marked as a "Top Match.
<br>
●
<b>Adaptive Ordering Mechanism:</b> Job postings must be arranged in a hierarchical
fashion, with the most relevant opportunities surfacing at the forefront.
